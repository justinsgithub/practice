/* Exercise 5-1. As written, getint treats a + or - not followed by a digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to
 * push such a character back on the input.
 */

/* Exercise 5-2. Write getfloat, the floating-point analog of getint. What type does getfloat return as its function
 * value?
 */

/* Exercise 5-3. Write a pointer version of the function strcat that we showed in Chapter 2: strcat(s,t) copies the
 * string t to the end of s.
 */

/* Exercise 5-4. Write the function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and
 * zero otherwise.
 */

/* Exercise 5-5. Write versions of the library functions strncopy, strncat, and strncmp, which operate on at most the
 * first n characters of their argument strings. For example, strncpy(s,t,n) copies at most n characters of t to s. Full
 * descriptions are in Appendix B.
 */

/* Exercise 5-6. Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers instead of array
 * indexing. Good possibilies include getline (Chapters 1 and 4), atoi, itoa, and their variants (Chapters 2, 3, and 4),
 * reverse (Chapter 3), and strindex and getop (Chapter 4).
 */

/* Exercise 5-7. Rewrite readlines to store lines in an array supplied by main, rather than calling alloc to maintain
 * storage. How much faster is the program?
 */

/* Exercise 5-8. There is no error checking in day_of_year or month_day. Remedy this defect.
 */

/* Exercise 5-9. Rewrite the routines day_of_year and month_day with pointers instead of indexing.
 */

/* Exercise 5-10. Write a program expr, which evaluates a reverse Polish expression from the command line, where each
 * operator or operand is a separate argument. For example, expr 2 3 4 + * evaluates 2 x (3+4).
 */

/* Exercise 5-11. Modify the programs entab and detab (written as exercises in Chapter 1) to accept a list of tab stops
 * as arguments. Use the default tab settings if there are no arguments.
