# joints

## arthritis and aging

### arthritis

- means inflammation of a joint (catch-all term)

#### osteoarthritis

- is a degenerative joint disease
- cartilage at end of bone is lost over time, which allows for bone on bone contact
- bone on bone contact will allow for osteoblasts to move faster which leads to bone spurs

#### gouty arthritis

- is acute inflammatory arthritis, caused from the crystallization of uric acid
- a diet high in purines will allow uric acid to build up, usually in joints that are more distal from the body
- can lead to erosion of the cartilage and the joint capsule itself
- purines around found in alcohol, processed meats (deli meats), common processed seafood

#### rheumatoid arthritis

- autoimmune disease (body is attacking itself)
- can cause a claw-like appearance of the hand
- body is sending signals causing the body to fight cartilage and tear it apart

## TMJ, Glenohumeral, Elbow, and Wrist

### Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ)

#### Articular Disc

- made up from condylar process of mandible and mandibular fossa of temporal bone
- articular disc divides the joint into 2 compartments, a superior compartment and an inferior compartment
- clinical considerations include dislocated mandible (mandibular condyle moves inferiorly and anteriorly) and TMJ syndrome (any type of weakening or damage to the TMJ area, the cure is move it less while it heals)

#### movements

- elevation / depression
  - elevation is closing mouth, depression is opening mouth
  - inferior compartment
  - hinge joint

- mandible protraction / mandible retraction
  - sliding back and forth (such as jutting jaw)
  - superior compartment

### Glenohumeral and Associated Joints

- multi-axial, most freely moveable joint in body, more mobility, less stability
- allows flexion / extension, adduction / abduction, medial / lateral rotation, circumduction
- where majority of injuries occur, along with the knee joint
- the shoulder joint
- glenohumeral is the most proximal joint of your upper limb
- head of humerus and glenoid cavity of scapula
- only 1 / 3 of the humerus head fits in the glenoid fossa because the head is so big

#### joint structures: labrum

- fibrocartilaginous rim
- deepens the glenoid cavity, allowing for better fit of the humeral head

#### joint structures: coraco-acromial ligament

- with bones, forms the coraco-acromial arch
- stop superior shoulder dislocation, by forming a sort of roof over the joint
- connects to coracoid process and acromion process (can feel acromion process by patting self on back)

#### joint structures: bursa

- similar to the joint capsule, but separate, its own entity
- found around more complex joints
- common area for bursitis, (particularly subacromial or subdeltoid)
- subscapular bursa communicates with joint capsule
- common area for inflammation, a lot of friction
- anytime you see blue on an anatomy illustration and it is not a vein, it is a bursa

#### associated muscles: rotator cuff

- main source of stability
- made up of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis
- surround the shoulder joint, but there is a gap at bottom of shoulder, (inferior location)
- shoulder dislocation = glenohumeral joint
- almost all shoulder dislocations occur in an inferior position, humeral head moves inferior into weak spot
- clinically shoulder dislocation is referred to as anterior or posterior dislocation, large majority are anterior (both are also almost always inferiorly)
- shoulder separation = acromioclavicular (AC) joint (so not actually the shoulder separating)
- "shoulder" separation can be complete tearing of the joint, complete disruption of the articular capsule, or it can be a more mild shoulder separation

### elbow joint and associated joints


- bony parts

  - condyle of humerus
    - trochlea (capitellum sits next to it)
    - olecranon fossa
    - coronoid fossa

  - ulna
    - trochlear notch
    - coronoid process
    - olecranon (or olecranon process) (pointy part of elbow)

#### joint structures: collateral ligaments

- ulnar collateral ligament
  - around outside of trochlea
  - most stability
  - capsular

- radial collateral ligament
  - around outside of capitellum
  - capsular
  - attached to anular ligament

#### associated joints: Humeroradial

- component of elbow joint
- referred to as a hinge joint, similar to the humero-ulnar
- sometimes referred to as a ball + socket joint
- movements include flexion / extension

#### associated joints: proximal radio-ulnar

- parts
  - Radius - head (button shaped)
  - Ulna - radial notch
  - Ligament - anular ligament (attaches head of radius to radial notch of ulna)
  - movements include pronation / supination

- clinical considerations
  - subluxation of radial head ('pulled elbow')

### radiocarpal (wrist) joint

- radio for "radius", not ulna, ulna is not involved in the wrist joint, ulna has big role in elbow joint

- bony parts

  - radius
    - distal end of radius

  - proximal row of carpals
    - scaphoid
    - lunate
    - triquetrum (when wrist is abducted)

#### condyloid joint (radiocarpal is a condyloid joint)

- flexion / extension
- abduction (radial deviation) / adduction (ulnar deviation)
- circumduction (complex circle movement of the 4 above)

#### associated joints: distal radio-ulnar

- more closely associated to the wrist, as opposed to the proximal radio-ulnar which is more closely associated to the elbow
- pronation / supination (moving bone is the radius)

## hip, knee, talocrural

### hip joint

- bony parts:
  - head of femur
  - acetabulum of coxal bone

- type of joint:
  - synovial: ball & socket

- movements:
  - flexion / extension (hyper extension moves it posteriorly)
  - adduction / abduction
  - circumduction (anytime you have all 4 movements above)
  - medial / lateral rotation (bend knee and move laterally - medially, like bending elbow and moving shoulder laterally - medially)

#### ligaments of hip joint

- iliofemoral ligament
  - prevents hyperextension
  - attaches from ilium to femur

- pubofemoral ligament
  - helps prevent hyperextension

- ischiofemoral ligament
  - helps prevent hyperextension

### knee joint

- bony parts:
  - 3 different joints
  - 2 femorotibial articulations (medial & lateral)
  - femoropatellar articulation

- type of joint:
  - synovial: hinge (modified, can slightly move in other directions)

- movements:
  - flexion / extension
  - flexion moves knee posteriorly (different than most other joints)
  - medial rotation, helps lock the knee into position and allow muscles to relax a little bit, which is helpful when standing for long periods of time
  - lateral rotation, popliteus muscle contracts allowing for lateral rotation of knee joint to start walking again

#### extracapsular ligaments of knee joint

- quadriceps femoris tendon plays biggest role in knee stability
- ligaments play a role in knee stability but not as much as the above tendon

- patellar ligament (tendon)
  - sesamoid bone
  - referred to as a ligament but is actually a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon
  - distal part of quadriceps femoris tendon

- fibular (lateral) collateral ligament (FCL)

- tibial (medial) collateral ligament (TCL)
  - weaker
  - attached to medial meniscus

#### menisci

- composed of fibrocartilage (which is avascular, no blood supply)

- medial meniscus
  - attached to TCL
  - less mobile

- lateral meniscus
  - nearly circular, smaller

#### intra-articular ligaments of knee joint

- anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
  - weaker (more often damaged)
  - terrible triad is when the TCL, medial meniscus, and ACL are damaged
- posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
  - important when stabilizing femur when walking downhill

### ankle (talocrural) and associated joints

- bony parts:
  - distal ends of tibia & fibula
  - talus

- movement:
  - hinge joint
  - flexion (dorsiflexion)
  - extension (plantarflexion)

- associated joint movement
  - subtalar, between calcaneus (heal bone) and talus
  - transverse tarsal, between together the (calcaneus and talus) and the rest of your tarsal bones
  - inversion (sole of foot moves laterally) / eversion (sole of foot moves medially) - from the above 2 joints

#### ligaments of ankle joints

- deltoid (medial) ligaments
  - a suite of 4 ligaments
  - stronger and more robust than what you have on the lateral side
  - all of these ligaments have an attachment on the medial malleolus (tibia)
  - fibers actually intertwine with tibia bone for a more solid attachment
  - large, strong
  - attach to medial malleolus
  - stabilizes ankle during eversion

- lateral ligaments
  - 3 separate ligaments
  - stabilizes ankle during inversion
  - also attach to medial malleolus, but fibers do not intertwine, so not as strong of attachment
