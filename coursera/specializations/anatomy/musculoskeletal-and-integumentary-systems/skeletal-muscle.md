# skeletal muscle

## properties and functions of muscular tissue; types of muscular tissue

- skeletal muscle cells (striated)
  - for the most part are voluntarily controlled
  - not all have a purely voluntary component


- cardiac muscle cells (striated)
  - cardiac muscle cells are solely located within the heart, making up the walls of the heart
  - cardiac muscle cells are involuntarily controlled and have their own "pacemaker" within
  - components within the heart (not the central nervous system) are going to allow the cardiac muscle cells to contract

- smooth muscle cells (not striated)
  - are associated with the gastrointestinal portion, forming the walls of your GI system
  - are also associated with blood vessels (such as arteries)
  - have myosin and actin, just not organized in the same manner
  - have a lot more extensibility
  - involuntarily controlled

- skeletal and cardiac muscle is referred to as striated muscle
  - this means the 2 main contractile protein filaments (myosin and actin) are organized into a sarcomere
  - organization when looking histologically at these particular cells will allow for a very organized appearance seen in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells

### properties of muscular tissue

- electrical excitability (can change due to some type of external stimuli) (muscles + nerve cells)
  - external stimuli can be something electrical or in terms of hormones
  - can have a stimuli, an ion change in terms of muscle tissue allowing for an action potential to allow for contraction

- contractility
  - all muscle tissue is capable of contracting
  - action potential allows for sarcomeres within skeletal muscles to contract
  - sarcomeres contracting allows for the muscles to move and move the bone in turn

- extensibility
  - the ability to stretch
  - different types of muscle tissue have different amounts of extensibility
  - skeletal muscle is kind of in between cardiac and smooth muscle
  - connective tissue plays a role in only allowing it to stretch so much

- elasticity
  - ability for muscle to go back to original shape without damage

### functions of muscular tissue

- producing body movements
  - contraction of muscle pulls the bone, allowing for movement to occur at the joints
  - without muscles, you would have no body movements

- stabilizing body positions
  - many muscles of the body are continuously contracting, (tiny contractions), that allow for the stabilization of body position.
  - such as sitting up right

- storing & moving substances within the body
  - calcium is a big one

- producing heat
  - when your muscles contract, heat is released
  - shivering is our muscles contracting to produce heat and warm us up
