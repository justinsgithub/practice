# medical terminology part 1

## introduction to medical language and records

### word parts

- medical terminology is made of 3 main building blocks, root, prefix, suffix
- like the roots of a plant, roots in med terms are the foundation / subject of the medical term

- common roots:
  - roots function like nouns in the language of medicine
  - the presence of a combining vowel tells us that the word part is a root
  - /o signifies that the word part is a root
  - some meanings may have more than 1 root, hemo and hemato both mean blood
  - root words with the same meaning can be spelled differently (angio, vaso, vasculo) all mean vessel

- suffixes:
  - added to end of the word to provide meaning

- prefixes:
  - comes at the beginning of the word
  - optional
  - further modify the root

## putting it all together

- we can take parts of medical terms and put them together to build entire words
- don't need to know the word to translate or build it
- medical terminology is all about being able to put the parts together

### a word on roots

- roots in medical terminology contain a /o, known a combining vowel
- the combining vowel is added to more easily combine the root with other word parts
- combining form = root + combining vowel
  - crani/o

- when to keep the combining vowel:
  - joining a root to any suffix beginning with a consonant (enter/o + -logy = enterology)
  - joining 2 roots together, even when the second root begins with a vowel (gastr/o + enter/o + -logy = gastroenterology)

- when to drop the combining vowel:
  - do not use a combining vowel when the suffix begins with a vowel
    - gastr/o + -ectomy = gastrectomy


### translating a medical term

- step 1:
  - breakdown word into smaller parts
  - makes it less intimidating and more manageable to consume
  - most medical terms have at least a root and a suffix
  - many terms will also have a prefix
  - some terms will have multiple roots
  - rules stay the same no matter how many parts a term has

- step 2:
  - start at the end,translate the suffix first
  - it is customary to say the meaning of the suffix first
  - psychology, logy is the suffix and means the study of, (the study of the mind) (the suffix comes first in the meaning)

- step 3:
  - translate the prefix
  - skip this step if word does not have a prefix

- step 4:
  - translate the root(s)
  - just like roots anchor a tree, roots in medical terms anchor the meaning
  - translate roots in order of appearance in order from left to right

- step 5:
  - put the parts together
  - tachycardia = ia + tachy + cardi = condition of + fast + heart



## medical records and abbreviations

- health records come in different lengths and formats
- EHR
  - electronic health record
  - more global record, with patient health history from multiple clinics, doctors, and visits
- EMR
  - electronic medical record
  - patients chart from a single clinic or practice visits
